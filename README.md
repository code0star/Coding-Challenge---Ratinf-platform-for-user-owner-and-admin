# 📚 Rate & Review Platform for Books

## 📘 Project Overview

I developed this Rate & Review Platform as part of my internship project. It's a full-stack web application that allows users to **rate and review books**, **authors to manage their submitted books and view feedback**, and **administrators to oversee the entire system**. The platform is built using modern web technologies and follows best practices in frontend and backend development.
